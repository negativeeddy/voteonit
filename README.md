# vote on it

This is a very early work in progress. A simple poll/voting service to experiment with the new [.NET Aspire stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview)
- ASP.NET minimal API backend
- Blazor front end
- Probably some other worker services later on
